        The Academy at Lincoln has many extracurricular clubs and activites. The Lego Robotics Club is one of them. In Lego Robotics, students program and build robots to make them 
        complete a set of tasks. Lincoln Academy in particular seems to be very good at this, making 3 different teams into state during the state competition.

        The new Academy at Lincoln cafeteria is a much better arranged and better functioning cafeteria than it was previously. The new fresh pizza, which is heated up on the spot, 
        is from SmartMouth, a company which specializes in making tasty foods with all the nutrients you would need. Not only this, but the 2 grades, 6th and 8th, which go to 
        the cafeteria at once, are also divided. This means that they can pick up their food at different times, meaning that the lunch lines are much less cramped than normal. 
        Also, students are now required to get at least one Fruit or Veggie per day to ensure that they stay healthy.

          Teachers are now able to take attendance at lightning speed with our new smart attendance system. Here are some of the features:
          <br>
          1. Easy: Teachers are now able to see where students are sitting, and only mark the children who are absent. Everybody else gets automatically filled in. 
          This means that teachers can get to teaching their material at the beginning of class instead of having to mark each individual child as absent or in school.
          <br>
          2. Reliable: Since the whole attendance system is online, you can rely on data to be reliably stored and managed. The whole entire school is on a VPN, 
          which means that no other people will be able to access your childs information.
          <br>
          3. Powerful: Using the Smart Attendance system, teachers and students alike will be amazed by how much data our system is able to store. We can make sure at the end of the year 
          that we know exactly the attendance schedule of our students.
          <br>
          4. Smart: As the name suggests, our attendance system is very smart. It is able to even take input from voices. It is easily able to access the internet through use of the VPN 
          and is able to automatically create a chart of all attendance. If there appears to be no internet, it can also be put on a
